## To set a background  for one slide 

For this background on one slide, add `{background-image="https://fordschool.umich.edu/themes/custom/ford/images/fallback-placeholder.png"}` after the title

## To set a theme for all slides {background-image="https://fordschool.umich.edu/themes/custom/ford/images/og-image.png"}

```yaml
theme: [../michigan.scss, ford.scss] 
```

## To set a theme for all slides 

```yaml
theme: [../michigan.scss, ford2.scss] 
```

## To set a theme for all slides {background-image="https://umaec.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/030630_fordpreferred.jpg"}

```yaml
theme: [../michigan.scss, weill.scss] 
```


## To make new themes

1. Find an image url or save an image in the slides folder

2. Make a .scss styling file. This is what "ford.scss" looks like: 

```
/*-- scss:rules --*/
.slide-background-content{
  background-image: url("https://fordschool.umich.edu/themes/custom/ford/images/og-image.png");
  background-size: 100% 100%;
  opacity: .1
}
```

3. Add your new scss style to the `theme:` line of the slide header 

```yaml
format:
 revealjs: 
   theme: [../michigan.scss, ford.scss] 
```
(these slides also use the .michigan.scss style)


## R code to make new slide theme files 

(overkill, but it shows how you can execute code in .qmd documents)

```{r}
url <- "https://fordschool.umich.edu/themes/custom/ford/images/fallback-placeholder.png"

paste('/*-- scss:rules --*/
  .slide-background-content{
      background-image: url("',
      url,
      '");
  background-size: 100% 100%;
  opacity: .1
}') |>
  write("ford2.scss")
```
