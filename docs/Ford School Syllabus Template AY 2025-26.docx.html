Some faculty also communicate that they may be able to meet at other times and that students should email them to schedule those appointments. Finally, office hours can be structured as drop-in times when more than one student can join, or they can be one-on-one sessions for specific time slots.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Student Mental Health and Wellbeing:</strong> The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students.&nbsp;We acknowledge that a variety of issues&nbsp;can directly impact students’ academic performance and overall wellbeing. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.</p>
<p>You may access the Ford School’s embedded counselor Paige Ziegler (pziegler@umich.edu) and/or counselors and urgent services at&nbsp;<a href="https://caps.umich.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>&nbsp;(CAPS) and/or&nbsp;<a href="https://uhs.umich.edu/">University Health Service</a>&nbsp;(UHS).&nbsp;Students may also use the Crisis Text Line (text ‘4UMICH’ to 741741)&nbsp;to be connected to a trained crisis volunteer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:</strong> The University of Michigan is committed to creating as accessible educational environment for students with disabilities as possible.<br>
If you anticipate or are experiencing barriers based on disability or temporary injuries, Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) (<a href="http://ssd.umich.edu">ssd.umich.edu</a>) is the office that students work with to explore reasonable accommodations, tools, and resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>you are already connected</strong> with SSD and have approved accommodations, please share your <a href="https://ssd.umich.edu/article/submitting-semester-requests">letter through Accommodate</a> as soon as possible so that we can discuss how your accommodations will be implemented in this course. The sooner I know about your disability access-needs, the more equipped I can be to facilitate accommodations. You should reach out to me and/or your Disability Access Coordinator if you have any questions or concerns about your accommodations.<br>
</li>
<li>If <strong>you have not connected</strong> with SSD and anticipate or are experiencing a disability-related barrier, and would like to discuss accommodations and/or resources, please contact SSD by completing their initial information form (<a href="https://ssd.umich.edu/">https://ssd.umich.edu/</a>)<br>
</li>
<li>If you have a <strong>temporary medical injury/condition</strong>, such as a broken arm, I may be able to assist in minimizing classroom barriers. In situations where additional assistance is needed, you should contact the SSD as noted above.</li>

Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor.&nbsp;If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g.&nbsp;social media), you must first have informed consent. <strong><em>Without explicit permission from the instructor and in some cases your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings or pre-recordings from class, discussion section or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Use of Generative AI:</strong> The Ford School does not have a policy regulating students’ usage of generative AI tools. We encourage you to set expectations and rules that make the most sense for your course and include a statement here. You can find several <a href="https://genai.umich.edu/resources/faculty/course-policies">example syllabi statements and resources on this site</a> to help navigate what might work best in your course, including statements on (1) AI use-permitted, (2) AI use-permitted depending on activity type, and (3) AI use-forbidden.</p>
